# Introduction to Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Recap
Last week, we have covered the following concepts in Python:
- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- ...

## Learning Objectives
For this week, we will focus on the data manipulation using Pandas. Pandas is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming. Since we are familiar with the basic concepts in Python, it should be easier to understand the syntax and data structures we use in this tutorial. 

By the end of the week you wil be able to implement the following functions:

- Connecting to Google Drive
- Importing data
- Getting info about the dataset
- Removing NaN (None) values
- Selecting subsets of data
- Filtering dataset based on criteria
- Aggregation functions
