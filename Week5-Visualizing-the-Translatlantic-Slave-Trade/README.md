# Visualizing the Transatlantic Slave Trade

## Labs and Methodoloy
Congratulations you have made it to the first lab of this course. The ideas of these labs is to help you apply the Data Science pipeline in a project based environment. You will be using the tools taught to you in the previous modules and adopt and Question and Answer based approach when you work with the dataset.
We have divided our approach into 4 parts:
- The first part is the traditonal set up every. data scientist should do before modifying the dataset.
- The second part involves clearning the the dataset and choosing columns that fit our methdology.
- The third part involves futher splitting our cleaned dataframe into smaller dataframes and visualiztion them.
- Finally, the fourth part involves summarizing our conclusion.

## Recap
- By this time, you should have an understanding and practice on how to implement the following:
- Loading a Dataset '.csv' as a dataframe using ```pd.read_csv```
- Observing the properties of the loaded dataset using functions such as:
    - ```pd.head()```
    - ```pd.describe()```
    - ```pd.info()```
- Modifying the dataset by removing ```NaN``` values.
- A conceptual understanding of the term ```object``` in DataFrames.
- Re-indexing columns
- Visualizing Data using ```matplotlib``` and ```pandas```:
    - Scatter plots
    - Barplots
    - Line plots
    - Histograms

## About the Dataset

### The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade

It is difficult to believe in the first decades of the twenty-first century that just over two centuries ago, for those Europeans who thought about the issue, the shipping of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic was morally indistinguishable from shipping textiles, wheat, or even sugar. Our reconstruction of a major part of this migration experience covers an era in which there was massive technological change (steamers were among the last slave ships), as well as very dramatic shifts in perceptions of good and evil. Just as important perhaps were the relations between the Western and non-Western worlds that the trade both reflected and encapsulated. Slaves constituted the most important reason for contact between Europeans and Africans fornearly two centuries. The shipment of slaves from Africa was related to the demographic disaster consequent to the meeting of Europeans and Amerindians, which greatly reduced the numbers of Amerindian laborers and raised the demand for labor drawn from elsewhere, particularly Africa. As Europeans colonized the Americas, a steady stream of European peoples migrated to the Americas between 1492 and the early nineteenth century. But what is often overlooked is that, before 1820, perhaps three times as many enslaved Africans crossed the Atlantic as Europeans. This was the largest transoceanic migration of a people until that day, and it provided the Americas with a crucial labor force for their own economic development. The slave trade is thus a vital part of the history of some millions of Africans and their descendants who helped shape the modern Americas culturally as well as in the material sense.

The details of the more than 36,000 voyages presented here greatly facilitate the study of cultural, demographic, and economic change in the Atlantic world from the late sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries. Trends and cycles in the flow of African captives from specific coastal outlets should provide scholars withnew, basic information useful in examining the relationships among slaving, warfare—in both Africa and Europe—political instability, and climatic and ecological change, among other forces. 

#### Facts about the dataset

- The dataset approximatey 36,110 trans-Atlantic voyages.
- The estimates suggest around 12,520,000 captives departed Afriva to the Americas. 

- Not all 36,000 voyages in the database carried slaves from Africa.
- A total of 633 voyages (1.8%) never reached the African coast because they were lost at sea, captured or suffered some other misfortune. 
- The database also contains records of 34,106 voyages that disembarked slaves, or could have done so (in other words, for some of these we do not know the outcome of the voyage).

- The latter group comprised mainly ships captured in the nineteenth century which were taken to Sierra Leone and St. Helena as part of the attempt to suppress the trade. 

## Learning Objectives
For this week our main focus will be to visualize our data when it's loaded in a Pandas DataFrame. For this we will be using **matplotlib** and **pandas**. You are familiar with pandas by now but matplotlib is new to you. Therefore, understanding and using the tools provided through matplotlib will be our main focus. By the end of the week you wil be able to implement the following ```commands```:
- Understand how  ```pyplot``` works and how to you can make customized plots using it.
- Use ```pandas``` to plot your dataFrame and map columns in the form of useful visualizations.
- Learn how to load and use Time-Series data using Pandas ```pd.read_csv```
- Use the 'Stock market data' to learn how to plot basic graphs and making them readable by adding:
  - colors
  - markers
  - linestyles
  - labels
  - ticks
  - legends
- Use ```matplotlib``` to create bar plots,line charts and scatter plots.
- Loading and Examining the California Housing dataset and mapping geo-location data:
  - Visualizing the distribution of median income of home owners in California.
  - Comparing the median income with the price of the houses.
  - Find Dense clusters using visualization techniques.
