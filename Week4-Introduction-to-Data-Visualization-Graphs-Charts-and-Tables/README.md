# Introduction to Data Visualization - DRAFT 1

## Recap
By this point we have looked into some important steps such as:
- Opening a google co-lab notebook.
- Importing libraries such as Pandas and Numpy.
- Loading datasets (.csv files).
- Observing datasets as pandas DataFrame.

## Learning Objectives
For this week our main focus will be to visualize our data when it's loaded in a Pandas DataFrame. For this we will be using **matplotlib** and **pandas**. You are familiar with pandas by now but matplotlib is new to you. Therefore, understanding and using the tools provided through matplotlib will be our main focus. By the end of the week you wil be able to implement the following ```commands```:
- Understand how  ```pyplot``` works and how to you can make customized plots using it.
- how to plot multiple variables in a single plot.
- Use ```matplotlib``` to create bar plots,line charts and scatter plots.
- Use ```pandas``` to plot your dataFrame and map columns in the form of useful visualizations.
- Examine the California Housing Dataset and construct a useful visualization of the data step by step.
