# Introduction to Data Visualization, Graphs, Charts and Tables - DRAFT 1

## Recap
By this point we have looked into some important steps such as:
- Opening a google co-lab notebook.
- Importing libraries such as Pandas and Numpy.
- Loading datasets (.csv files).
- Observing datasets as pandas DataFrame.

### Learning Objectives
For this week our main focus will be to visualize our data when it's loaded in a Pandas DataFrame. For this we will be using **matplotlib** and **pandas**. You are familiar with pandas by now but matplotlib is new to you. So understanding and using the tools provided by matplotlib will be our focus. By the end of the week you wil be able to implement the following ```commands```:
